              Keeping records of activities of several organizations With the
              help of "1C:Accounting 8 for Kyrgyzstan" you can keep accounting
              and tax accounting of economic activities of several

              accounting of several organizations in a common information base

              This is convenient if the economic activities of these
              organizations are closely related to each other: it is possible to
              use common lists of goods, counterparties (business partners),
              employees, warehouses (storage locations), etc., and to generate
              mandatory reporting separately.

            <p>
              Accounting of inventories For the organization of accounting of
              inventories, the following methods of valuation of inventories at
              their disposal are supported: <br />
              at average cost; at the cost of first-in-time acquisition of
              inventories (FIFO method). To support the FIFO method of
              valuation, batch accounting is maintained in inventory accounts.
              Different costing methods may be used for different inventory
              accounts (according to IAS 2). <br />
              <br />

              Warehouse accounting Warehouses may have quantitative or
              quantity-accounting. In the first case, the valuation of goods and
              materials does not depend on the warehouse from which they are
              received. Warehouse accounting can be disabled if there is no need
              for it. <br />
              <br />

              In "1C:Accounting 8 for Kyrgyzstan" inventory data are recorded,
              which are automatically reconciled with the accounting data. On
              the basis of the inventory is reflected the identification of
              surpluses and write-off of shortages.

              <br />
              <br />
              Accounting of trade operations Accounting of operations of receipt
              and sale of goods and services is automated. When selling goods,
              invoices for payment are issued, delivery notes and invoices are
              issued. All wholesale trade operations are accounted for in the
              context of contracts with buyers and suppliers. Reflection of
              returns of goods from the buyer and the supplier is automated.
